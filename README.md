# inverse-obstacle-scattering2d
This repository contains codes for solving inverse obstacle scattering problems 
to recover the shape of the obstacle for sound soft, sound hard, and 
penetrable objects. 

# Dependencies
* Fortran compiler, such as gfortran packaged with GCC (> 6.3.0)
* GNU make

# Quick installation instructions
* For linux, run ``make install''
* For Mac OSX, run ``cp make.inc.macosx make.inc'' followed by ``make
  matlab''

This should generate the appropriate mex files in the ``matlab/''
directory.

After the generation of the mex file, run ``startup.m'' in MATLAB, this
will set correctly the PATH variables in MATLAB.

To verify successful installation of the program, run ``tests/test_all.m'' in 
MATLAB. The output in matlab should be::

    Successfully completed 3 out of 3 tests in the ios2d testing suite

# Examples
This package can be used in two modes: 

* Data generation mode: To generate sensor measurements corresponding to the solution of acoustic scattering
from a known obstacle. The generation of such a
data set for a star shaped domain is demonstrated in
``examples/data_generation_scripts/starn_tensor_data.m''
* Inverse problem mode: To generate the shape of the obstacle, given sensor measurements. 
An example solution for the inverse problem, given a precomputed
dataset, is demonstrated in
``examples/inverse_solver_scripts/star3_inverse_test.m''
